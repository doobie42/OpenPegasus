1- Download this image: 

	https://debian.beagleboard.org/images/bone-debian-8.6-lxqt-4gb-armhf-2016-11-06-4gb.img.xz

2- FLASH on an SD CARD ( balenaetcher did the job for me)

3- BOOT ON SD CARD BY PRESSING BBB S2 button

4- then modify uEnv.txt via ssh
From beaglebone site for flashing
Flashing eMMC
To set up the standalone microSD image to automatically flash the eMMC on powerup. Login as debian (password = temppwd) and edit /boot/uEnv.txt with nano (sudo nano /boot/uEnv.txt) or your preferred editor.

In /boot/uEnv.txt:

##enable BBB: eMMC Flasher:
#cmdline=init=/opt/scripts/tools/eMMC/init-eMMC-flasher-v3.sh
Change to:

##enable BBB: eMMC Flasher:
cmdline=init=/opt/scripts/tools/eMMC/init-eMMC-flasher-v3.sh
Optional, update Flasher Scripts:

cd /opt/scripts/
git pull
and reboot the system, it'll flash the eMMC on the next bootup. (make sure to remove the microSD after flashing is complete, otherwise it'll just keep on re-flashing the eMMC)	

5- then Reboot and religion via ssh

6- git clone http://github.com/doobie42/OpenPegasus

7-execute install script 1:

./OpenPegasus/InstallScripts/install_script_1.sh

Follow prompts if needed

8-After reboot, execute install script 2

cd /home/debian/
./OpenPegasus/InstallScripts/install_script_2.sh

9- Enjoy your NEW PegasusTouch with these commands:

Run OpenPegasus (Right now there is no GUI, even though it is called GUI, I disabled it for the time being):
	
	bin/gui <calib file> - would bring up GUI when available
	bin/gui <calib file> z - debug tool for z axis
	bin/gui <calib file> zup  - moves the Z axis up about 2 cm
	bin/gui <calib file> galvo - galvo calibration (works OK, not perfect)
	bin/gui <calib file> zcal - z axis calibration (not implemented)
	bin/gui <calib file> <gcode file> - print gcode file

Note: there are 3 profiles I setup for the laser, they control the delay beween enabling/disable the laser and moving the galvo.  The slower will be more accurate, to change:
		cd mainapp/hardware
		rm profilegalvo.hp
		ln -s profiles/<profile>.hp profilegalvo.hp
		./compileLaser
		   default.hp - slowest
		   faster.hp  - medium
		   fastest.hp - fastest (might move laser too quickly, but will print faster)

Trouble shooting:
	prussdrv_open open failed
	gui: prussdrv_open failed
	     If you get this error, it means the PRU wasn't setup/enabled properly.

	     Either modprobe uio_pruss (doesn't need reboot, but will need to be done every boot)
	     Or add "uio_pruss" to /etc/modules (recommended; needs reboot)
	      

	BBB- wireless
	     Seems to hang or lock up
	     	   Power management is likely on:
		   1) Current boot: Execute: sudo /sbin/iwconfig wlan0 power off
		   2) Every boot: Create a cron job with the following 
		   	  @reboot sleep 60 && /sbin/iwconfig wlan0 power off
